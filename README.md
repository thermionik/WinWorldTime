A window for your desktop capable of displaying the times of multiple cities on glorious 7-segment displays. This is the ideal clock program for those engaged in cyberdefense. Knowing the local time of your adversaries at a glance can prove invaluable in numerous situations.
The gif below appears broken, but the clock program works, I promise.
